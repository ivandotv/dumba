# Introduction

Dumba.js is a small library (4KB) for handling form data, it is built on top of Mobx.js. It does not contain any validation rules, so it is recommended to use tried and tested third party validation libraries like [Validator.js](https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js)

## Demo

Take a look at this simple form [Demo]('') that shows pretty much all the functionality of the library.

You can also play with it in [CodeSandobx]('')

## Installation

```sh
npm install dumba
```
